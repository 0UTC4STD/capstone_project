Capstone Project Proposal 
Financial Portfolio Manager 
Dylan Courtemanche

Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a web-based application that will allow users to manage their stock portfolio. In this app the users will be able to create accounts then have multiple different portfolios and will be able to select stocks to “purchase” and track profit/loss based on current market values. This application will be built using the React framework on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end.

Background:
With the growing popularity of investing in the stock market, there is a need for a user-friendly application that can help investors keep track of their portfolio. Many existing stock portfolio management tools are either too complex for novice investors or too simplistic for experienced traders. This application will bridge the gap by providing an intuitive interface with advanced features for users who want to take control of their investments.


Features:
The proposed web application will offer the following features:

User registration and login: Users will be able to create an account and log in to access their portfolio.

Portfolio management: Users will be able to add, remove, and edit stocks in their portfolio. They will also be able to view their portfolio's current value and track their performance over time.

Real-time data updates: The application will use real-time stock market data to provide users with up-to-date information about their portfolio's performance.

(Stretch Goal) Customizable alerts: Users will be able to set alerts to notify them of significant changes in their portfolio's value or specific stock prices.

Technology Stack 
The application will be built using the following technologies:

Frontend: React, Redux, and Chart.js for data visualization.

Backend: Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL for data storage and management.

API: IEX Cloud for real-time stock market data and news.

Conclusion:
The proposed web application will provide users with an easy-to-use tool to manage their stock portfolio. The use of real-time stock market data, investment recommendations, customizable alerts, and news updates will make this application a valuable resource for investors of all experience levels. By utilizing the React and Node.js frameworks, we can create a scalable and efficient web application that can be easily maintained and updated.
